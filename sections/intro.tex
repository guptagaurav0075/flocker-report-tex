\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

The {\em flocking} behavior of birds in flight has been simulated by several computer and mathematical models. {\em Flocker} is inspired from the exhibit at {\em Exploratorium, San Francisco} \cite{jillflock}. However, unlike the exhibit, {\em flocker} is a browser based simulator.

The simulator is strictly divided into two parts: \mbox{\em Flocker core}, \mbox{\em Flocker UI}. {\em Flocker core} is covered in \ref{flocker} and {\em flocker UI} is covered in \ref{flockerUI}. The {\em flocker core} is responsible for the simulation. It defines the birds and their behavior. The {\em flocker ui} is responsible for connecting the end user with the simulation. By enabling the end user to modify the key variables, they are able to visualize the flocking behavior of the birds in the simulation space.
