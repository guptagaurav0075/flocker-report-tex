\section{Conclusion and Future Works}
\label{concFuture}

We have implemented an interactive web-based visualization tool for simulating bird flocking behavior.
In the future this tool can be extended to leverage touch based gestures in the touch capable devices to give a better user experience. Additional affordances can be designed for controlling the variables easily and accurately.
